This is my final unity project. It takes data on the number of youths in NYC as of 2016 in FosterCare in relation to how many of these youths are on target to graduate in 4 years time. I used a comination of animation tools and animation scripts to create the effect of a conveyor belt and chairs moving on that belt.
