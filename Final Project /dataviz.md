Proposal for a data-viz/streaming project 



+My idea is to use data to visuzlize the number of children who enter foster Care each year in New York State. I was able to find an site with an api to use this information and how many are actually being adopted each year. I'm choosing this dataset because I met someone who was in fostercare and was never adopted but aged out. 
+To complete this project I'll need to learn how to implement an api in unity. I will need to bring in some assests to make the project look like what I have in mind on my sketch. I will need a script that uses the takes a gameobject or just object and removes it from the larger pile at a certain rate. Ill needed a spawner object/script to represent the kids placed in state care.
