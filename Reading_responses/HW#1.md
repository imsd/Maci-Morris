I thought the game was pretty fun. I was confused a bit throughout the game but towards the end of my 3rd attempt i got somewhat better. The interface was okay. The main screen or like office was decent. I thought that it was a bit difficult to see the icons on the bottom of the screen sometimes.  I loved the little party hate icons. So many options on hardware. And so many lawsuits. That part sucked. Otherwise pretty fun, i spent 5 hours on the game.
