For our projection mapping project we will be creating an art piece in unity that takes a video input and unity shapes to create a simple scene. For this project we will need to create a simple landscape in unity and source some colorful video footage(or make the footage ourselves). We will have to find and learn how to implement a script that allows us to add video to unity objects. The video would be displayed on unity cubes, cylinders, or spheres. We plan to use a rotate and transform script as well. We will likely be using a couple of large boxes and some smaller ones to create a sense of depth and hierarchy. The intention is to make the boxes into some sort of sculpture surface for projection. Since we do not already know how to use a script that allows users to add video to unity objects that could be a bit difficult. We intend to have the user have some level of input. To keep the project manageable, that input will probably be in the form or a keyboard general script.
