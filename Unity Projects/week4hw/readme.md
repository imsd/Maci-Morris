# Project 1 Maci Morris 

First project with user input


![the project in action](proj1.gif)

My project is not a game but more of an interactive system. Users can use the left and right arrow keys and the left mouse button to move tiles and create spheres. The intention of this project for me was to try to get as many pieces moving as possible and have a pop of color in a kind of chrome scene.
