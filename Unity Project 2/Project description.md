Our project is a interactive city display. Our aim was to create a city like scene where users would be able to control a few of the elements. There are city buildings with billboards attached, a moving cube of advertisments and falling spheres. The Billboards display a video of adventure time. The rotating cube displays videos from various animes as ads. They can be user controlled by using the arrow keys and numbers 1 and 2. The spheres come in a blue and green and when the a and space keys are presses the spheres are released; they fill up the the "street". There are 4 cameras used in this scene.
